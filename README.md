*"Always with you, what cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?"*

BOARD is the flagship tool in the YODA suite, revolutionizing the way digital technicians and photographers manage their visual workflow. Whether you call it a board, layout, moodboard, or contactsheet - the concept remains the same: maintaining a comprehensive overview of your shoot is crucial for ensuring consistency and creative coherence.

### Why BOARD Matters
During a photo shoot, maintaining a clear overview of your project is paramount. A well-organized board serves multiple critical purposes:
- Provides a comprehensive view of the entire shoot
- Ensures visual consistency across all images
- Creates a professional reference document for clients
- Helps track progress and identify gaps
- Facilitates communication between team members
- Supports creative decision-making in real time

### The Traditional Challenge
Traditionally, creating these layouts has been:
- Time-consuming and labor-intensive
- Requires switching between Capture One and other applications
- Prone to inconsistencies in formatting
