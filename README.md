## Privacy

**‣BOARD** now features enhanced offline capabilities. An internet connection is only required for the initial license validation. After this first authentication, the application automatically creates a secure cryptographic local license, enabling complete offline functionality. This local license system ensures uninterrupted workflow even without internet access, making BOARD fully operational in any working environment. All features, including contact sheet creation, Capture One integration, and Adobe CC workflows, remain fully functional offline. The application periodically checks for updates when internet is available but never requires online validation for normal operation after initial setup.
Privacy and Data Security: BOARD is designed with strict privacy in mind. The application does not collect, transmit, or store any user data, images, or usage information. The only server communication occurs during the initial license validation and optional update checks. All work remains entirely local on your machine, ensuring complete confidentiality of your creative projects.
